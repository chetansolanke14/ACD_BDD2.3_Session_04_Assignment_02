Below is the solution for each attached screen shot explained with the comment used:

Assignment_02_01: Dataset.txt file is created and the data is validated using "cat Dataset.txt"

Assignment_02_02: data is dumped in pig using below command 
dataset = LOAD 'dataset.txt' USING PigStorage(',') as (int:userId,int:movieID,chararray:tag,int:timestamp);
DUMP dataset;"


Assignment_02_03: CONCAT() is used to combine
dataset_concat= FOREACH dataset GENERATE CONCAT ((chararray)movieID,tag);
DUMP dataset_concat;"

Assignment_02_04: Below comment are used to tokenize
tokenize_data= FOREACH dataset GENERATE TOKENIZE (tag);
DUMP tokenize_data"

Assignment_02_05: SUM()
group_data= GROUP dataset by userId;
SUM_data= FOREACH group_data GENERATE SUM(dataset.userId)
DUMP SUM_data;"

Assignment_02_06: MIN() is used below command is used in this screen shot to get the output
group_data= GROUP dataset all;
min_data= FOREACH group_data GENERATE MIN(dataset.userId);
DUMP min_data;"

Assignment_02_07: MAX() is used below command is used in this screen shot to get the output
group_data= GROUP dataset all;
max_data= FOREACH group_data GENERATE MAX(dataset.userId);
DUMP max_data;"


Assignment_02_08: LIMIT() is used below command is used in this screen shot to get the output
result= LIMIT dataset 5;
DUMP result;"

Assignment_02_09: STORE() is used below command is used in this screen shot to get the output
group_data= GROUP dataset all;
STORE group_data INTO '/home/acadgild/LocalFS/pigop1'using PigStorage(',');"

Assignment_02_11:  Screen shot shows the output file store in the pigop1 file

Assignment_02_12:DISTINCT() is used below command is used in this screen shot to get the output
A= LOAD 'pigip' USING PigStorage(',');
dataset =LOAD 'pigip.txt' USING PigStorage(':');
DUMP dataset
distinct_data= DISTINCT dataset"

Assignment_02_13: Shows the output of distinct output by removing duplicates field

Assignment_02_14:FLATTEN() is used below command is used in this screen shot to get the output
data_flt= FOREACH dataset GENERATE FLATTEN($2);
DUMP data_flt;"
